# One-Sitting
My first-ever game made in Godot. I don't have a release date for the game yet since school is eating up most of my time right now.

Your goal is to get to the treasure in order to progress through the levels until you beat the game. But you have to do all of that in one sitting without dying or else the game force closes itself, without saving any data. Currently, there are only 5 levels, but I'll add more soon!
